```
wp db drop
```

Search and replace:

```
wp search-replace 'old-url' 'new-url'
```

## MySQL

If you want, you can use standard MySQL commands. 

Database dump:

```
docker exec CONTAINER-NAME sh -c 'exec mysqldump DBNAME -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"' > backup.sql
```

Database import:

```
docker exec -i CONTAINER-NAME sh -c 'exec mysql -uroot DBNAME -p"$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"' < backup.sql
```
